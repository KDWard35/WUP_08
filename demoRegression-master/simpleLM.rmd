```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model WEIGHT ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(WEIGHT~NECK,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```


## Compare all models that predict WEIGHT other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better. 

```{r}
simp <- lm(WEIGHT~AGE,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~AGE,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

This is weight predicted by age. The adjusted r-squared value is 0.5526.

```{r}
simp <- lm(WEIGHT~HEADLEN,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~HEADLEN,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

This is weight predicted by head length. The adjusted r-squared value is 0.69.

```{r}
simp <- lm(WEIGHT~HEADWTH,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~HEADWTH,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

This is weight predicted by head width. The adjusted r-squared value is 0.6064.
